# About Silksong.UnityHelper

Silksong.UnityHelper is a library to help with common Unity operations.

## Usage

Add the following line to your .csproj:
```
<PackageReference Include="Silksong.UnityHelper" Version="1.1.0" />
```
The most up to date version number can be retrieved from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silksong.UnityHelper).

You will also need to add a dependency to your thunderstore.toml:
```
silksong_modding-UnityHelper = "1.1.0"
```
The version number does not matter hugely, but the most up to date number can be retrieved from
[Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/silksong_modding/UnityHelper/).
If manually uploading, instead copy the dependency string from the Thunderstore link.

It is recommended to add UnityHelper as a BepInEx dependency by putting the following attribute
onto your plugin class, below the BepInAutoPlugin attribute.
```
[BepInDependency("org.silksong-modding.unityhelper")]
```
